## Fibonacci numbers

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence  

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where:  
1. The first and second numbers are both ``1``, that is, ``fibonacci(1) = fibonacci(2) = 1``
2. The numbers that follow are the sum of the previous TWO numbers, so  
``fibonacci(3) = fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1) = 1 + 1 = 2``  
``fibonacci(4) = fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2) = 2 + 1 = 3``.

```
TODO: Answer the following questions:
fibonacci(5) = 5
fibonacci(6) = 8
fibonacci(7) = 13
fibonacci(8) = 21
fibonacci(9) = 34
```

## Basic implementation

Let's take a look at an implementation:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
You can also find this in ``algorithms-labs-gw26/lab1/fibonacci.py``, and run it: 
```bash
cd algorithms-labs-gw26/lab1
python fibonacci.py
```
The code version also tells you how much time does it take to complete each calculation.
```
TODO:
1. Explain what the code above is doing.
A: Using recursion to find the fibonacci of all the whole numbers before ours and adding them all together

2. What happens if we remove the "if ... return ..." and only keep the last line?
A: The fibonacci will enter negative numbers causing us to enter an infinite recursion, leading to stack overflow

3. What is fibonacci(20)? how much time did it take to calculate that?
A: 1.4838e-03 seconds

4. What is fibonacci(30)? how much time did it take to calculate that?
A: 1.3607e-01 seconds

5. How much time did it take you to calculate fibonacci(40)? (this might take a while...)
A: 1.4257e+01 seconds
```

## How many function calls?

Modify ``fibonacci_counting.py`` so that it does the same calculation as ``fibonacci.py``, but it also counts how many times the function ``fibonacci(n)`` had to be called. Then answer the following:
```
TODO:
1. How many function calls does fibonacci(1) take? 1
2. How many function calls does fibonacci(5) take? 15
3. How many function calls does fibonacci(10) take? 177
4. Why is it so slow? Where does the complexity come from?
The time took to perform recursion all the way until n = 0, then return those answers all the way back to be add the total
5. Is this O(n)? is this O(2^n)? Why?
It is O(2^n) because it is consistently larger than the recursion program, making it the ceiling time complexity
6. Is this Ω(n)? Why?
Yes because the recursion program is consistently larger than linear time complexity, making it the floor or Ω time complexity
```

## Memoization Optimization

Take a look at ``fibonacci_counting.py``, where memoization is used.
```
TODO:
1. How is this one different from the previous one?
The cache holds the answers of previous calculations as data, so fibonacci of 5 will calculate fibonacci 4 and fibonacci 3, instead of fibonacci 4 calculating fibonacci 3 and fibonacci 2, the cache just hands over the data obtained from fibonacci 3, saving that time.

2. How much time does it take to calculate fibonacci(30)? 
6.6100e-05 seconds

3. Why is it often faster?
If the number or a part of its recursion has previously been calculated, the time complexity reduces

4. Also modify this file to count: how many times the function had to be called for fibonacci(30)?
59 times

5. Is this O(n)? is this O(2^n)? Why?
O(2^n) because it is consistently slower than the recursion program, making it the upper bound

6. Is this Ω(n)? is this Ω(2^n)? Why?
Ω(n) because it is consistently faster than the recursion program, making it the lower bound
```

## Extension: Staircase Problem

Implement ``fibonacci_threeway.py``, where:
1. The first, second, and third numbers are ``1``.
2. The numbers afterwards are the sum of the previous **THREE** numbers, instead of two.
3. Your implementation should be optimized, taking less than 1 second to calculate ``fibonacci_threeway(50)``.

## Optional, challenge problems
1. Instead of recursion, implement ``fibonacci(n)`` using iteration instead.
2. ``fibonacci_memoized.py`` fails if you give it a very large input number such as one million - why? Try fixing it.
3. There is an even faster way to calculate fibonacci numbers, in (almost) O(1) time. Read Wikipedia and try to implement it, or if you like a big challenge, implement it without looking it up.
